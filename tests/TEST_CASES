test_two.sh: '1 producer and 1 consumer. Then, the producer goes offline.'
After the producer is disconnected the worker detects the crash and starts serving data either from the cash or the database. In case there is no data in the cache older data is returned from the database.
The test demonstrates that producer crashes are handled gracefully without service interruption..
